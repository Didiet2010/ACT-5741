Financial Results for the Third Quarter of 2022
Revenues

Total revenues in the third quarter of 2022 were RMB13,002.1 million (US$1,827.8 million), representing an increase of 32.6% from the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of 26.3% from the second quarter of 2022.

Vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2022 were RMB11,932.7 million (US$1,677.5 million), representing an increase of 38.2% from the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of 24.7% from the second quarter of 2022. The increase in vehicle sales over the third quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2022 was mainly attributed to higher deliveries as a result of a more diversified product mix offered to our users.

Other sales in the third quarter of 2022 were RMB1,069.4 million (US$150.3 million), representing a decrease of 8.5% from the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of 48.2% from the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in other sales over the third quarter of 2021 was mainly due to the decreased revenue derived from sales of automotive regulatory credits, offset by the increase in other revenues in line with the incremental vehicle sales. The increase in other sales over the second quarter of 2022 was mainly attributed to the increased revenue derived from sales of automotive regulatory credits and increase in other revenues in line with the incremental vehicle sales.
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin

Cost of sales in the third quarter of 2022 was RMB11,267.0 million (US$1,583.9 million), representing an increase of 44.2% from the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of 25.9% from the second quarter of 2022. The increase in cost of sales over the third quarter of 2021 was mainly driven by the increase of delivery volume and higher battery cost per vehicle. The increase in cost of sales over the second quarter of 2022 was attributed to the higher delivery volume.

Gross profit in the third quarter of 2022 was RMB1,735.1 million (US$243.9 million), representing a decrease of 12.9% from the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of 29.5% from the second quarter of 2022.

Gross margin in the third quarter of 2022 was 13.3%, compared with 20.3% in the third quarter of 2021 and 13.0% in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease of gross margin over the third quarter of 2021 was mainly attributed to (i) the decreased revenue from sales of automotive regulatory credits with high sales margin, (ii) the decrease of vehicle margin, and (iii) the reduction in other sales margin resulting from the expanded investment in power and service network. The increase of gross margin over the second quarter of 2022 was mainly attributed to the sales of automotive regulatory credits with high sales margin.

Vehicle margin in the third quarter of 2022 was 16.4%, compared with 18.0% in the third quarter of 2021 and 16.7% in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease of vehicle margin over the third quarter of 2021 was mainly attributed to the increased battery cost per unit, which was partially offset by the decrease in subsidization in user vehicle financing arrangements. Vehicle margin remained stable compared with the second quarter of 2022.
Operating Expenses

Research and development expenses in the third quarter of 2022 were RMB2,944.5 million (US$413.9 million), representing an increase of 146.8% from the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of 37.0% from the second quarter of 2022. Excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP), research and development expenses were RMB2,571.4 million (US$361.5 million), representing an increase of 134.8% from the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of 37.2% from the second quarter of 2022. The increase in research and development expenses over the third quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2022 was mainly attributed to the increased personnel costs in research and development functions as well as the incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies.

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2022 were RMB2,712.5 million (US$381.3 million), representing an increase of 48.6% from the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of 18.8% from the second quarter of 2022. Excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP), selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB2,490.8 million (US$350.2 million), representing an increase of 49.4% from the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of 19.6% from the second quarter of 2022. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses over the third quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2022 was mainly due to (i) the increase in personnel costs related to sales and general corporate functions, (ii) increased expenses related to the Company's sales and service network expansion, and (iii) increase in marketing and promotional activities to promote our vehicles in China and Europe.
Loss from Operations

Loss from operations in the third quarter of 2022 was RMB3,870.3 million (US$544.1 million), representing an increase of 290.2% from the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of 36.0% from the second quarter of 2022.

The increase in share-based compensation expenses over the third quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2022 was primarily attributed to the grant of restricted shares on a continued basis.
Loss before Income Tax Expense

The increase of other losses over the third quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the loss from the revaluation of our overseas Renminbi-related assets as a result of the depreciation of Renminbi against U.S. dollars in the third quarter of 2022.

Non-GAAP Disclosure
The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted cost of sales (non-GAAP), adjusted research and development expenses (non-GAAP), adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (non-GAAP), adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP), adjusted net loss (non-GAAP), adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders (non-GAAP), adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share (non-GAAP) and adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS (non-GAAP), in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company defines adjusted cost of sales (non-GAAP), adjusted research and development expenses (non-GAAP), adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (non-GAAP), adjusted loss from operations (non-GAAP) and adjusted net loss (non-GAAP) as cost of sales, research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, loss from operations and net loss excluding share-based compensation expenses. The Company defines adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders (non-GAAP), adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share (non-GAAP) and adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS (non-GAAP) as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, basic and diluted net loss per share and basic and diluted net loss per ADS excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value. By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss or other consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned "Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" set forth at the end of this press release.
